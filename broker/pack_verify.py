# pack_verify.py
"""Pack safety verifier (promoter design §6c, §9 invariants 1, 3, 4).

The single most security-critical decision in the promoter: given a loaded
``Pack``, the trusted keys, and the current live capability set, decide whether
the pack is safe to install. Pure function — no I/O beyond what callers pass in.

A pack is INSTALLED only if EVERY one of these holds (else ``PackRejected``):

  1. Signature present and verifies against a trusted, non-revoked key, over
     EXACTLY ``pack_format.canonical_bytes(pack)`` (so any tampering after
     signing breaks verification).
  2. Data-only — every capability's ``executor`` is either ``mcp_tool`` with a
     tool name, OR ``subprocess`` whose ``binary`` is EXACTLY one of
     ``VETTED_EXECUTORS``. No other executor type, no unknown binary path, no
     near-miss path (matching is byte-exact — no normalisation). A pack can
     never introduce new code across the boundary.
  3. No reserved-name redefinition — no pack capability name is in
     ``RESERVED_CAPABILITIES`` (an explicit security-critical set unioned with
     the live ``policy.NO_STANDING_GRANTS`` so the two cannot drift apart).
  4. No collision with an existing live capability — installing is additive;
     updates go through the reviewed path.
  5. Policy immutability — the manifest contains ONLY a ``capabilities`` key.
     Any other top-level key (``policy``, ``no_standing_grants``,
     ``mcp_tools`` …) is refused: a pack can never touch policy.
  6. Declared == defined — ``meta.capabilities`` exactly equals the set of
     ``name``s defined in ``manifest.capabilities`` (no hidden capabilities,
     no phantom declarations).
  7. The pack defines at least one capability — an empty pack is meaningless
     and is refused explicitly (two empty sets would otherwise satisfy #6).

Every failure raises ``PackRejected`` with a precise reason. Fail-closed: no
bare excepts, no silent return-None — there is no path out of this function
that approves a pack without satisfying all seven checks.
